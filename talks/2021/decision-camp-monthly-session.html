<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kogito is a new platform and framework capabilities based on Drools, jBPM and OptaPlanner, designed to bring our traditional, battle-tested business automation engines to the cloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have rethought the architecture of our platform to enable Java and JVM developers to realize distributed business automation applications with ease.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leveraging modern application development frameworks, such as Quarkus, we can integrate seamlessly into a large range of capabilities. In particular, Quarkus has shown how it is possible to push the boundaries of traditional Java frameworks to make them cloud-native, through the power of GraalVM’s native compilation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a quick introduction to Kogito we will show with practical examples how to build cloud-native event-driven business applications, to the point where applications can be even deployed in a serverless environment, through Knative. We will also show what challenges a distributed environment poses, and how we can deal with them effectively thanks to Kogito.</p>

He has a huge experience as Java developer having been involved in (and often leading) many enterprise level projects in several industries ranging from media companies to the financial sector. Among his interests there are also functional programming and Domain Specific Languages. By leveraging these 2 passions he created the open source library lambdaj with the purposes of providing an internal Java DSL for manipulating collections and allowing a bit of functional programming in Java. He is also a Java Champion and the co-author of “Modern Java in Action” published by Manning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteomortari">Matteo Mortari</a> is a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat, where he contributes in Drools development and support for the DMN standard. Matteo graduated from Engineering with focus on enterprise systems with a thesis involving rule engines which sparked his interests and influenced his professional career since. He believes there is a whole new range of unexplored applications for Expert Systems (AI) within the Corporate business; additionally, he believes defining the Business Rules on the BRMS system not only enables knowledge inference from raw data but, most importantly, helps to shorten the distance between experts and analysts, between developers and end-users, business stakeholders.</p>
