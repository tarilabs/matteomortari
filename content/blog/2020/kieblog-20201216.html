<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Event Abstract</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kogito is a new platform and framework capabilities based on Drools, jBPM and OptaPlanner, designed to bring our traditional, battle-tested business automation engines to the cloud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have rethought the architecture of our platform to enable Java and JVM developers to realize distributed business automation applications with ease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leveraging modern application development frameworks, such as Quarkus, we can integrate seamlessly into a large range of capabilities. In particular, Quarkus has shown how it is possible to push the boundaries of traditional Java frameworks to make them cloud-native, through the power of GraalVM’s native compilation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quick introduction to Kogito we will show with practical examples how to build cloud-native event-driven business applications, to the point where applications can be even deployed in a serverless environment, through Knative. We will also show what challenges a distributed environment poses, and how we can deal with them effectively thanks to Kogito.</p>

Matteo graduated from Engineering with focus on enterprise systems with a thesis involving rule engines which sparked his interests and influenced his professional career since. He believes there is a whole new range of unexplored applications for Expert Systems (AI) within the Corporate business; additionally, he believes defining the Business Rules on the BRMS system not only enables knowledge inference from raw data but, most importantly, helps to shorten the distance between experts and analysts, between developers and end-users, business stakeholders.</p>
