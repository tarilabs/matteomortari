<p><em>Modernising kie-server with new and more user-friendly DMN endpoints, better Swagger/OpenAPI documentation, easier JSON-based REST invocations; an intermediate step to help developers transitioning to service-oriented deployments such as a Kogito-based application.</em></p>   
<h2>In a nutshell:</h2>   
<p>The current DMN kie-server endpoints are fully compliant with kie-server extension design architecture, and aligned with all other kie-server services and extensions; however, some aspects of the current <em>generic</em> approach of kie-server sometimes are not very user-friendly for DMN evaluations, due to limitations of swagger documentation and the REST payloads requirements to follow the generic kie-server marshaller protocol. These aspects do apply to all kie-server services, including naturally DMN kie-server endpoints as well.<br>On other hand, experience shown that building manually the REST payload on Kogito for DMN evaluation is very easy for end-users, thanks to key features pertaining to DMN core capabilities.</p>   
<p>This <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DROOLS-6047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new feature (DROOLS-6047)</a> extends DMN on kie-server with new endpoints, leveraging those core capabilities; the new DMN endpoints provide better Swagger documentation and can be more easily consumed by end-users, therefore contributing to modernising the kie-server platform while also making easier to eventually transition to a full Kogito-based application and deployment!</p>   
<h2>Why is this needed?</h2>   
<p>Currently on kie-server, the DMN service exposes 2 endpoints which are fully compliant with kie-server extension design architecture:</p>   
<ul>
 <li><code>GET /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn</code><br>Retrieves DMN model for given container</li>
</ul>   
<ul>
 <li><code>POST /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn</code><br>Evaluates decisions for given input</li>
</ul>   
<p>The current swagger documentation is agnostic to the actual model content of the knowledge asset, like for any other kie-server extension:</p>   
<p class="has-text-align-center text-center"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oxigk0UqjxH7mDJdq-qQ0Z3gNWoDE6x8SkjTc90fd3FjMjXkURajiFOV3jmWUyKtZuLaLH_TmmA6couiVz__OsxFrlh9AlXpEIq9uHv1EqEo9_GtwlCL0bqwEXbhSGRxeePVlz5g" class="img-fluid"></p>   
<p>This limited style of swagger documentation is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>sometimes</em></span> an undesirable side-effect to the <em>generic</em> approach of kie-server extension design:</p>   
<ul>
 <li>all kie-server extensions receive as input a generic String, which is actually converted internally to the extension using the generic kie-server marshaller.<br>This causes the swagger documentation to not display anything meaningful for the request body besides Model==string, and the only helpful information can only be provided as a comment (“<em>DMN context to be used while evaluation decisions as DMNContextKS type</em>”).<br></li>
 <li>all kie-server extensions return as output a <code>ServiceResponse&lt;T&gt;</code>, where the Java’s generic T is extension-specific. Generating swagger documentation with Java generics is already limited, in this case the difficulty compounds because the actual content of T varies, by DMN model to model !</li>
</ul>   
<ul>
 <li>the DMN evaluation payload itself contains the coordinates of the model to be evaluated <em>and</em> the model-specific input context, per the original implementation requirements; but this interconnection between model coordinates <em>values</em> and input content <em>structure</em>, is pragmatically impossible to be defined meaningfully with a Swagger or OpenAPI descriptor.</li>
</ul>   
<p>About the last point specifically, consider this example DMN payload:</p>   
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
       "model-namespace": "https://kiegroup.org/dmn/_FA9849E2-C92E-4E27-83BF-07A7428DC9C9",
       "model-name": "Traffic Violation",
       "dmn-context": {
           "Driver": ...,
           "Violation": ...
       }
    }</code></pre>   
<p>because the <em>content</em> of <code>dmn-context</code> depends on the <em>values</em> of <code>model-namespace</code> and <code>model-name</code> coordinates, there is no pragmatic way to define with Swagger/OpenAPI that <code>dmn-context</code> must have the properties “Driver”, “Violation” for this traffic violation model, or property “Customer” for another DMN model.</p>   
<p>Besides endpoint documentation limitations, experience proved that building <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">manually from scratch</span></em> the kie-server generic payload following the style of the kie-server generic marshaller is very difficult for most end-users (in fact we always advise to use the Kie Server Client API first, and not start from scratch, but this suggestion is often ignored anyway):</p>   
<ul>
 <li>XML/JAXB format requires domain model pojo to be correctly annotated first, and building Java collection manually is quite tricky.</li>
</ul>   
<ul>
 <li>XML/XStream is a more natural format, still requires domain model pojo annotations, requires to respect the domain object FQN, but is yet another xml format while most end-users seem to prefer json instead.</li>
</ul>   
<ul>
 <li>JSON/Jackson would be the user preference nowadays, but requires to respect the domain object FQN which is very alien to json native users.</li>
</ul>   
<p>Example. The correct way to marshall for Traffic Violation example, respecting the domain model defined in the kjar project, would be:</p>   
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
       "model-namespace": "https://kiegroup.org/dmn/_FA9849E2-C92E-4E27-83BF-07A7428DC9C9",
       "model-name": "Traffic Violation",
       "dmn-context": {
           "Driver": { <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"com.acme.Driver" : {</span></strong>
               "Points": 15
           }},
           "Violation": { <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"com.acme.Violation" : {</span></strong>
               "Type": "speed",
               "Date": "2020-10-01",
               "Actual Speed": 111,
               "Speed Limit": 100
           }}
       }
    }</code></pre>   
<p>Everything would be much more easier, while building the JSON body payload manually for DMN evaluation, if we could drop the <em>strict</em> requirement to respect the generic kie-server marshalling format.</p>   
<h2>NEW model-specific DMN kie-server endpoints</h2>   
<p>We can now move past and beyond these limitations, thanks to the <em>next generation</em> of DMN endpoints on kie-server, leveraging some new DMN core capabilities:</p>   
<ul>
 <li>programmatic generation of Swagger and OpenAPI (Swagger/OAS) metadata (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DROOLS-5670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DROOLS-5670</a>)</li>
 <li>consistent DMNContext build from JSON, based on DMN Model metadata (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DROOLS-5719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DROOLS-5719</a>)</li>
</ul>   
<p>to ultimately offer more user-friendly endpoints on kie-server for DMN evaluation!</p>   
<p>Following similar style to what is offered today via Kogito, summarized in this <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2020/08/kogito-2840-about-dmn-endpoints-on-kogito.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, we implemented the following new DMN endpoints on kie-server:</p>   
<ol>
 <li><code>GET /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn<strong>/openapi.json</strong> (|.yaml)<br></code>Retrieves Swagger/OAS for the DMN models&nbsp;in the kjar project<br></li>
 <li><code>GET /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn/models<strong>/{modelname}</strong></code><strong><br></strong>Standard DMN XML but with<span style="text-decoration: underline;">out</span> any decision logic, so this can be used as a descriptor of the DMN model (which are the inputs, which are the decisions), while using the same format of the DMN XSD instead.<br></li>
 <li><code>POST /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn/models<strong>/{modelname}<br></strong></code>JSON-only evaluation of a specific DMN model with a body payload tailored for the specific model<strong><br></strong></li>
 <li><code>POST /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn/models/{modelname<strong>}/{decisionServiceName}<br></strong></code>JSON-only evaluation of a specific decision service of a specific DMN model with a body payload tailored for the specific model<strong><br></strong></li>
 <li><code>POST /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn/models/{modelname}<strong>/dmnresult</strong></code><strong><br></strong>JSON-only evaluation of a specific DMN model with a body payload tailored for the specific model, but returning a JSON representation as a DMNResult<strong><br></strong></li>
 <li><code>POST /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn/models/{modelname}<strong>/{decisionServiceName}/dmnresult</strong></code><br>JSON-only evaluation of a specific decision service of a specific DMN model with a body payload tailored for the specific model, but returning a JSON representation as a DMNResult</li>
</ol>   
<p>For the difference between “business-domain” and “dmnresult” variants of the rest endpoints, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2020/08/kogito-2840-about-dmn-endpoints-on-kogito.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reference the original blog post</a> as also linked above.</p>   
<p>Making reference to the Traffic Violation example model, this new capability can now offer on kie-server something similar to:</p>   
<p class="has-text-align-center text-center"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xlHutscoULeSZNrfLyGAhwC82Z23J9f_Q9ToTKUhX_3An7K1Z8DEmLTHDm19UoUtGmGhbDIPxl04e1jsDnEP0k6YbIWjplU-eaLl1bWJJIyplmKVgdMa5lreuH3eO80_oCp4bOth" class="img-fluid"></p>   
<p>As we can see, both the input body payload and the response body payload offer Swagger/OAS schemas which are consistent with the <em>specific</em> DMN model!</p>   
<p>This is possible thanks to a convergence of factors:</p>   
<ul>
 <li>Because each REST POST endpoint for DMN evaluation is specific for DMN model in the REST Path, it is possible to offer Swagger/OAS definition which are DMN model-specific<br>e.g.: because <code>POST /server/containers/<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mykjar-project</span></strong>/dmn<strong>/<span style="text-decoration: underline;">traffic-violation</span></strong></code><br>is a REST endpoint specific to the Traffic Violation model, both its input and output payload <em>can</em> now be documented properly in the Swagger/OAS schema definitions.<br></li>
 <li>Because each Swagger/OAS definition is offered at kjar/kie-container level, it is possible to generate programmatically the schema definitions for the DMN models contained only in the specific container.<br>e.g.: because <code>GET /server/containers/<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mykjar-project</span></strong>/dmn<strong>/<span style="text-decoration: underline;">openapi.json</span></strong></code><br>would offer only definitions for the DMN models inside “mykjar-project”.<br>This is thanks to the following DMN core capability: programmatic generation of Swagger/OAS metadata (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DROOLS-5670">DROOLS-5670</a>)<br></li>
 <li>Because these endpoints are DMN evaluation specific and focusing on a natural and <em>idiomatic JSON usage</em>, they do NOT require to follow the <em>generic</em> kie-server marshalling format.<br>This is thanks to the following DMN core capability: consistent DMNContext build from JSON based on DMNModel metadata (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DROOLS-5719">DROOLS-5719</a>)</li>
</ul>   
<h2>Any limitations?</h2>   
<p>Being a new set of endpoints, in addition to the currently existing ones, there is basically no impact on the already-existing DMN kie-server capabilities.</p>   
<p>As this proposed set of new endpoints are contained within a specific {containerId}, it also means that the openapi.json|.yaml swagger/OAS definition file is only kie-container specific.</p>   
<p>In turn, it means when accessing the swagger-ui client editor, user need to manually point to the container URL, for example something like:</p>   
<p class="has-text-align-center text-center"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bQw9Vx3SposkXY6xhA1HVG7GAN_UvsFr00gDQfOTwnbPYhv8vp9ff1bPNmrYHsKHdQrW9Dil_XkuReD7OWAZHRgyMKYwQLh1WUzMgRBNKbJvw9ql8MM6JbjnTbbLT1mQZOjTBLAk" class="img-fluid"></p>   
<p>Finally, as this core capability do leverage Eclipse MicroProfile for OpenAPI Specification (OAS) and SmallRye-openapi-core, this requires making use of Swagger-UI and clients which are compatible with OpenAPI Specification version 3.0.3, onwards.</p>   
<h2>Conclusions</h2>   
<p>We believe this feature meaningfully <em>extends</em> the current set of capabilities, by providing more user-friendly DMN endpoints on kie-server!</p>   
<p>Developers can make full use of this new feature to simplify existing REST call invocations, and as a stepping stone to eventually migrate to a Kogito-based application.</p>
